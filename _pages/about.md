Lucie is a postdoc at CopeNLU, a NLP research group located at the University of Copenhagen (Københavns Universitet). She earned her PhD from the School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, as part of the Web and Internet Research Group. She was a Bloomberg Intern in London UK, a research associate at the TIB Scientific Data Management Research Group in Hanover and was part of the part of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN [WDAqua](http://wdaqua.eu/).

Her research interests are include the topics of supporting lower-resourced language speakers online, particularly on Wikipedia, [cross-cultural NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13722), [editor behaviour on Wikipedia](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3442442.3452337), and mutlilinguality in knowledge graphs such as Wikidata.  

One of her projects adresses the question of how to support Wikipedia editors in creating a high-quality article by suggesting them section headings and references to use in their language.
This work is part of the [Scribe project](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Scribe), funded by a Wikimedia Project Grant (2019/2020) and a CredCo Grant (2020).

She worked as a software developer at Wikimedia Deutschland in the Wikidata team. There, she was already involved in the previously mentioned topics, developing the [ArticlePlaceholder](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Generating_Article_Placeholders_from_Wikidata_for_Wikipedia_-_Increasing_Access_to_Free_and_Open_Knowledge.pdf) [extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ArticlePlaceholder), which displays Wikidata's structured knowledge on Wikipedias of small languages.
