title: "Scribe - Helping editors of under-resourced languages to create new high-quality Wikipedia articles"
excerpt: "Scribe is an editing tool designed for underserved language Wikipedias, addressing the lack of information and participation in non-English languages. The tool facilitates article creation by providing section planning, reference collection, and key points for editors in under-resourced communities. By leveraging techniques from Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, Scribe aims to improve the editing experience, allowing editors to contribute based on community interests and notability criteria, independent of existing content in other Wikipedias.<br/><img src='/images/scribe_background_slide.png'>"

Wikipedia, one of the most visited and read websites in the world, is a widely used resource to access information about a variety of topics. However, while a few language versions cover a variety of topics, other languages are barely supported. A large part of the world’s population only has limited access to information. This information poverty affects readers of Wikipedia strongly, as they are not able to find information on a variety of topics. To create a more diverse encyclopedia, Wikipedia has to retain new editors and support existing editors in creating articles.

Scribe aims at supporting new editors retention. We tackle some of the challenges newcomer editors face while creating their first articles. From an editor’s perspective, our tools work in the following way: An editor decides to create a new article on a topic of their choice. When starting to write the article, they are able to choose Scribe as a supporting tool. Scribe suggests them a structure of an article, i.e., section headings, and references for the article in the editors' language.

Scribe is currently being tested on two language Wikipedias in communication with the community - Arabic and Catalan. The project was funded by a Wikimedia project project grant 2019/2020, and consists of a team of two researchers and one software developer.

Wikipedia Reference API
------

Based on the Scribe project, we created a Wikipedia reference API, aimed to facilitate the automatic detection of misinformation and to help creation of a trustworthy score of news publishers based on their usage on Wikipedia.
